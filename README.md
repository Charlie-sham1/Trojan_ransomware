# Trojan_ransomware

Ransomware that loads application in the frontground while running ransomware in the background. The ransomware is specifically designed for speed and prioritises targetting Linux directories with only the most sensitive files not the whole harddrive or ssd. Download the imported modules to test it (not on your own system ofcourse)
